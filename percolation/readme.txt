Programming Assignment 1: Percolation


/******************************************************************************
 *  Describe how you implemented Percolation.java. How did you check
 *  whether the system percolates? This should be something like 3-5 sentences.
 *****************************************************************************/

It first checks the four surrounding spots to see if they are open and if so connects 
them with the union(). Then I used the find() method to see if the curret node is 
connected to the top. 


/******************************************************************************
 *  Perform computational experiments to estimate the running time of
 *  PercolationStats.java for values values of n and T when implementing
 *  Percolation.java with QuickFindUF.java.
 *
 *  To do so, fill in the two tables below. Each table must have at least
 *  4 data points, ranging in time from around 0.1 seconds to at most a few
 *  minutes. Do not include data points that takes less than 0.1 seconds.
 *  Each data point should be double the size of the preceding data point

/******************************************************************************
 *  Using the empirical data from the above two tables, give an estimate
 *  of the running time of PercolationStats.java as function of both n and 
 *  T, using asymptotic notation, like:
 *
 *       O( N^2.0 * T )
 *
 *  Recall that with asymptotic notation, you are interested in the
 *  growth rate of run time as input sizes grow - you drop lower-order
 *  terms and constant factors. In class, we've discussed a way to 
 *  estimate polynomial factors from empirical run times.
 *
 *  How does this estimate compare to the theoretical run time growth
 *  rate, according to analysis of your code?
 *
 *****************************************************************************/

The worst case for quickfind in this case is O(T * N^2). From my empirical data 
and finding the ratios of each and averaging that I ended up with O( N^3.4 * T^.4)

Run time estimate:

 From my empirical data I got an estimated runntime of O( N^2.5 * T^2).

I worked with the TA a few times to get everythig working. I also worked with 
Soren and Nate to bounce ideas off of and figure out more of the conceptual parts. 
A couple of my functions specifically the tests, were either taken from one of them
or modeled after what they had.
